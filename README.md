# C++ Consistent Project Layout

Adapted from [Pitchfork](https://github.com/vector-of-bool/pitchfork) as a template model 
following the [specification](https://api.csswg.org/bikeshed/?force=1&url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vector-of-bool/pitchfork/develop/data/spec.bs#libraries).

This is a work in progress :

- [x] Standard project directory layout.
- [ ] Github-CI integrations.
- [ ] CMakelists.txt templates.
- [ ] Codecoverage and Build status.
- [ ] Build scripts.
- [x] Clang standard model.
- [x] Catch2 for writting tests.
